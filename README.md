This is where we fetch all the additional color schemes for noctalia-shell from.
If you want your color scheme to be added to noctalia-shell, you will have to create a PR over here.

It is **no longer necessary** to create the terminal/ subfolder with Noctalia Shell 4.2+ - All terminal colors go in the main json file.
